# Adding images to markdown

If you submit your code as markdown (recommended!), you can place your images in this folder.

The correct markdown syntax for an image is shown in various examples throughout the guide.

A typical image starts with an exclamation mark (!), followed by square brackets with the alternate text, followed by round brackets with the relative path of the image.

For example:
![An image of a car park on the moon](moon_park.png)

The image above was created with the following markdown syntax:

```markdown
![An image of a car park on the moon](images/moon_park.png)
(assuming the image is in the images subfolder)
```
